          <p>Two years ago, I sent a very brief email to immediate family members. Was it the best way to approach the situation? I still don't know, but it worked for me.</p>
          <blockquote>Dear Family, We are writing you to let you know we will no longer be attending church. I know that this may come as a shock to some. We are writing you to avoid the propagation of rumor and to assure you that we will still be the same people we have always been at the core. We have made this decision after a great deal of thought and consideration. We love you all and hope that we can remain very much a part of your lives. After all, we're family! Side note: we will be in Europe for the next month, so if you write us and we don't write back, it's because we're enjoying the beauty of Iceland, Paris, Lyon, Venice, Rome, Florence, Cinque Terre, or Nice. Talk to you all soon! Love always, Grant and Bethanie</blockquote>
          <p>I'll spare you the back story here, but suffice it to say that I felt like the religion I was brought up in just wasn't working for me, and hadn't been for years. I'm not writing this post today to rehash the countless hours that I contemplated the options for me to live a happy and fulfilling life.</p>
          <p>I'm writing this post today to report that I'm happy with my choices thus far. I know that's not the narrative that my Mormon family or friends necessarily want to hear, but it's true.  I've heard that if you have to justify your happiness, you're not truly happy. My response? That's why I haven't posted anything about this for the last two years. I've been too busy enjoying life.</p>
          <p>Here's the simple truth: there are a lot of ways to live a happy, fulfilling life. Many people tend to think that their way is the only way, but it's just not true in the slightest. In the end, that's my biggest problem with Mormonism and all of Christianity for that matter. “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” Translation: My way is the only way. I vehemently disagree. The world is a beautiful place where people approach living in so many different ways.</p>
          <p>And before you say that I'm forgetting about all of the suffering in the world, I'm not. There are a lot of improvements to be made, and if religion motivates you to improve the world, that's great! I'm not trying to put anyone down. I'm just trying to make to broadcast to the world that I'm doing great, and I really don't need to be “rescued.”</p>
          <p>To those who see me as someone to be rescued, sorry, it's not my fault I'm happy.</p>
